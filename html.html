    <h1>Building my Website</h1>
<p>I saw the submission aspect of this project as an opportunity to dive a little deeper into HTML. Since github takes quite a bit of time for the website to update whenever pushed, I wasn't the biggest fan of using it for the learning process. Upon doing a little research, I found replit.com. Replit has a feature (in beta, so it was a bit glitchy) that lets you write HTML and see the resulting page simultaneously (pictured below).

I wanted to give my website an early internet feel, but doing so with HTML alone was going to be a bit tricky. I ended up using some CSS in addition to help with formatting and styling. My progress was slow at first, but once I started to understand how the languages work things startedd making a lot more sense. I wanted to have each of the aspects of the project to have its own page, so I created 4 .html files (one for each page). I then used anchor tags to link between the pages to make navigation of the site simple and easy. I uploaded all of my images to imgur.com, a central/permanent location so that when I needed to transfer back over to github, the transition would be nice and smooth. To embed my pdf onto one of the pages, I used an iframe tag. For fun, I also included the comic sans font by uploading its .TTF file to the repository then linking to it in the CSS. When the time came to go back over to github, all I had to do was re-upload all the files and copy/paste the source code. Since it would take far too long to explain every little thing I did, I included the source code below. Despite the messy code and relatively unprofessional looking outcome, I learned a ton while working on this website and I am very happy with the result :)
