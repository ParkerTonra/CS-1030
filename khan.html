  <h2><strong>Module 1: Data Tools</strong></h2>
    <p class="indented">  
      Data is everywhere, and computers are equipped with a number of tools to streamline the process of storing and organizing data. Raw data must first be organized into a database before it can be understood by various programs. This can be done in a number of ways, most commonly in a text file or a spreadsheet. With the data organized into a database, users can interact with it through use of a query language. Query languages, most commonly Standard Query Language (SQL), have many different functions for analyzing the data that allow for filtering, averaging, counting, etc. With these tools, it becomes far easier to determine trends and correlations among different points of data.

  <h2><strong>Module 2: Big Data</strong></h2>
    <p class="indented">   
      When a set of data gets big enough, it quickly becomes too much of a hassle for a single person to analyze it. Things like pictures from satellites, images from MRI scans, as well as digital library archives add up to literal petabytes of data. Information at this scale is commonly referred to as “big data”. Storing and analyzing big data comes with huge demands as far as processing power and storage space. In addition, ethical concerns arise with the responsibility of housing that much data, especially in the case of personal information such as medical records.
Fortunately, computers offer many solutions that make analyzing big data less of a daunting task.

    <h2><strong>Module 3: Bias in Machine Learning</strong></h2>
    <p class="indented">   
      One way to quickly analyze overwhelming amounts of data is by employing the use of machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms are programs which improve themselves over time as new data is processed. Many machine learning algorithms today utilize “neural networks” which move information through a series of “neurons”, much like the human brain.  Machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in making predictions based on data from the past, but this doesn’t come without its drawbacks. If the data fed to the algorithm contains biases, the algorithm will inevitably become biased itself. Some of these biases can be manually adjusted or remedied by increasing the sample size fed to the algorithm, but underlying historical biases are harder to avoid.

      <h2><strong>My Experience with the Unit Test</strong></h2>
    <p class="indented">   
      The unit test took me three tries to get a 100 and it brought back many memories of reviewing for AP tests in high school (memories I tried to forget). There were quite a few trick questions that got me the first go around, especially the ones with multiple correct answers. There is, however, a dire need for precision in data analysis. I feel that the review did a solid job of hammering this idea in. After all, a simple error in data analysis could cause the data analyst to look quite silly. What is data worth if it can’t be reported with 100% accuracy? Another highlight of the review was looking at multiple different categories to draw conclusions that were not obvious until doing so. Practicing these skills segued nicely into me analyzing some data for myself.
